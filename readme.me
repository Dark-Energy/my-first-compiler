This is project from my 'children' age. When i am studied compiler theory, i want to develope compiler. Firstly, i create interpriter for my own programming language 'UNIVAC'. Then i want create true compiler. It compiler take programm, written in 'UNIVAC' (languagle, invented by me) and doing just-in time compilation and running. First it do parse throgh 'top down recursion', then build syntaxic tree, do some primititve optimisation and generate output in machine code for processor x86,eventually run this codeI was trying create compiler, generated Portable Executable files, but this work was abandoned.*foldersPortable Executable - propably, my first expirience with generation exe-filessource - source code for jit-compilertests - examples program on UNIVACPasToEvl - i don't know what is doingFinally, this programm seemed disfunctional. It Need to recompile all projects and testing. But why?
